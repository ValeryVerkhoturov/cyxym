<h1>WHO?</h1>

<p>
  We are three schoolmates, which weren't sitting on the spot and geography was
  boring, because we've learned everithing in advance. Everyone can build a
  website, especially since it's a simple website. You don't even need to code,
  but we decided to write it.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>one has learned how to write websites,</li>
  <li>the other was a fan of history,</li>
  <li>and the third one just suggesting ideas.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  We've distributed tasks right in school and started to work. I, David
  Kistauri, was a leader, programmer, designer and copywriter. Batal Kiut wrote
  a text about the history not even Sukhum, but the whole of Abkhazia. Leonid
  Gadliya helped with logo and ideas.
</p>
<p>
  It was cool and we want to work on new projects and websites. You can contact
